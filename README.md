# ICA-DP_Harmonization
Harmonization of multi-site MRI data with dual-projection based on ICA 
## Introduction 
While combing the multi-site MRI data has great convenience that enhances the statistical results and obviates some of the shortcomings of single-site study, the site effects comes naturally, confounding the MRI data analysis and making the results hard to interpret. We proposed a dual-projection data-driven method based on ICA to eliminate the site effects and preserve the signal of interest. 
## Input and Output
Input:  
**X**, Data matrix with two dimensions of (subject, feature).  
**L**, subject loadings extracted by ICA.  
**Site_Index**, the labels of components that significantly related to site effects.  
**Covariates**, signals of interest to be preserved, e.g., age, gender or variables refer to disease.  

Output:  
**X_ICADP**, the harmonized data by ICA-DP
